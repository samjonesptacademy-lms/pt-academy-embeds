Dear [Hiring Manager Name]

I am writing to apply for the Personal Trainer position at Wellness Hub, as advertised on your website. After successfully completing my Level 3 Personal Training qualification, I am excited to transition into fitness—a field that aligns with my long-held commitment to health and wellbeing. Your facility's inclusive approach to community fitness and commitment to accessible, evidence-based programming resonates strongly with my own values and career aspirations.

My career transition is supported by relevant experience: during my practical placement, I gained hands-on experience designing progressive training programmes and delivering group fitness instruction to mixed-ability classes of 15-20 participants. I developed proficiency in movement assessment, exercise modification for different fitness levels, and clear technical communication—skills directly applicable to supporting Wellness Hub's diverse community membership. Furthermore, my previous career in customer service equipped me with strong interpersonal abilities, patience, and genuine interest in supporting individuals to overcome barriers to fitness—qualities essential for working with beginners and individuals returning to exercise.

I am committed to continuous professional development and am currently exploring specialist certifications in functional movement assessment and training older adults. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my qualification, community-focused mindset, and enthusiasm for evidence-based fitness could contribute to Wellness Hub's mission. I am available for interview at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.
